List the components of Hadoop 2.x and explain them in detail
    Hadoop consists of the following components 
        a) HDFS : HDFS is hadoop file distributed system.It is advanced than the HDFS in hadoop 1.x.
        b) Map Reduce : It is a processing module of hadoop 2.x
        c) YARN : YARN is Yet Another Resource Negotiator.It is the key component.
            All the components of hadoop works on top of these above mentioned major components
        *It is a Master-Slave architecture.Both the master and slave nodes contains Map reduce and HDFS components.
        *Master node has resource manager and HDFS.Slave nodes has node manager and HDFS.
        *HDFS in master node is called as name node.It stores the metadata.
        *The resource manager in master node is Map reduce.
        *There is a second level master node in this architecture which contains node manager,application master and data node.
        *The application master executes specific programs.
        *The second level master node contains two or more slave nodes.
        *The slave nodes have node manager and HDFS.The HDFS of slave node is also called as datanode.
        *This datanode stores the actual node.There is no application master component.
        Description :
                 *The resource manager is divided into Scheduler and Application manager
                 *The scheduler decides in assigning the resources to the applications.
                 *The application master interacts with scheduler and node manager.
                 *Application master acquires resources using scheduler
                 *Application master interacts with node manager to do specific tasks.
                 *Each master node or slave node contains container.it is a part of memory on HDFS.
           The process is
                 *Client submits an application to the resource manager.
                 *Resource manager allocates a container.
                 *Then the related node manager is contacted
                 *The node manager launches the container.
                 *Finally container executes the application master
           
        Map Reduce is used to process the data stored in HDFS.It analyses the large data sets in parallel.
        It consists of two daemons-job Tracker and Task Tracker
